    - Makes disparaging **attacks/insults** against a specific person or group of people
    - Based on an outlandish premise about a group of people
    - Disparages against a characteristic that is not fixable and not measurable
- Isn't grounded in reality
    - Based on **false information**, or contains absurd assumptions
